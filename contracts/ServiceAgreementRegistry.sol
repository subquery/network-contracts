/**
 * @title Service Agreement Registry Contract
 * @dev
 * ## Overview
 * This contract tracks all service Agreements for Indexers and Consumers.
 * For now, Consumer can accept the plan created by Indexer from Plan Manager to generate close service agreement.
 * Indexer can also accept Purchase Offer created by Consumer from purchase offer market to generate close service agreement.
 * All generated service agreement need to register in this contract by calling establishServiceAgreement(). After this all SQT Toaken
 * from agreements will be temporary hold in this contract, and approve reward distributor contract to take and distribute these Token.
